## Description

Design and test a binary -> 7 segment display module (to display adder results) on a Basys 3 FPGA. The design was implemented and tested using AMD Vivado 2023.1.

## Instructions to run

Download all of the provided files and create a new project using AMD Vivado 2023.1. Add Adders.v and Display.v as design sources, Basys-3-Master.xdc as a constraint file, and testbench.v as a simulation source. Select the Xilinx Artic-7 FPGA (XC7A35T-ICPG236C) as the board. Ensure that Display.v is selected as the top module for design sources, and testbench.v is selected as the top module for simulation sources.
